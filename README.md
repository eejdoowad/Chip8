# Chip8
A Chip-8 emulator written in C. Inspired and heavily drawing upon the work of others (see References).

---This is still a work in progress---

To build on Mac, just call make in the build-mac directory. This generates an executable in the bin directory.

To build on Windows with Visual Studio 2013, open build-windows/chip8.sln, change the configuration to Release mode and hit build.
Again, an executable will be generated in bin.

This project isn't complete. I'll have better instructions later...
